# student-grade-prediction-using-Different machine learning algorithm


In this project, I used dataset from Undergrad Unversity to perfrom student grade prediction. The variables in this dataset include Sex, Number of hours studies daily, High school grade, Activities etc.

The aim of this project is to compare different machine learning algorithm to predict student grade in advance in other to reduce the overall dropou rate
